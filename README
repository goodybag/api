#Commits

All commit messages should follow the guide here: http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html
that describes the general structure of a good commit message. Adding to the standards listed in the guide, the following standards should also be followed:

1. All messages begin with a verb in the imperative sense.
2. Limit verbs to `Add`, `Fix`, `Change`, `Remove`.
3. Place a colon (`:`) after the verb. `Add:`, `Fix:`, etc.
4. Make sure every commit is signed using `--signoff`.

If struggling for a good commit message just ask what the patch would do if installed. Would it *Add: Feature X* or *Fix: Issue #00000*?
